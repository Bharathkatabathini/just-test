If you have multiple github accounts we need to create a configuration files
for them for example like this
//account 1
Host github.com
    User git
    HostName github.com
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
//account 2
Host github.com
User git
HostName github.com
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_200
//
so on.. like this
start evaluating with by starting ssh agent 
1.eval ($ssh-agent -s)
after evaluating need to add public key to github.com by cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa
can generate a ssh key by using the coomand ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "katabathini.bharath2000@gmail.com"
2.then add ssh key by
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
3.Test
ssh -T git@github.com-account_2000
4.Then you can push 


**List of commands**
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "youremail.com"
eval ($ssh-agent -s)
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
ssh -T git@github.com-account_2000
